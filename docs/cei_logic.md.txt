# Class Engagement Index (CEI)

CEI is a simple score between 0 and 100.

It combines:
- Attendance
- Participation
- Attentiveness

## Scoring

Participation:
- High = 40
- Medium = 25
- Low = 10

Attentiveness:
- High = 40
- Medium = 25
- Low = 10

Attendance:
- (number_present / class_size) × 20
- Maximum of 20 points

## Final CEI
CEI = Participation + Attentiveness + Attendance

This score is used for reflection, not punishment.
