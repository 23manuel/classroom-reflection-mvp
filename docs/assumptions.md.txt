# Project Assumptions

- Teachers submit at most one reflection per class per day
- Missing days are allowed and expected
- Exam periods may cause gaps in data
- CEI is a reflection aid, not a performance score
- Teachers work independently and cannot see each other’s data
- Each school is isolated from others
