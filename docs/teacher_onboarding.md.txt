# Teacher Onboarding Guide

## Welcome
This tool is a classroom reflection journal. It is designed to support your teaching, not to monitor or judge your performance.

There are no penalties for missed days and no comparison with other teachers.

## What You Do Daily
After each class, or at the end of the day, you record a short reflection for a class you taught.

Daily input includes:
- Class and subject
- Number of students present
- Participation level (low, medium, high)
- Attentiveness level (low, medium, high)
- Task given (if any)
- Topic
- Optional short note

This should take less than two minutes.

## What the Levels Mean
Participation:
- High means many students actively contributed
- Medium means some interaction
- Low means most students were passive

Attentiveness:
- High means students were mostly focused
- Medium means attention came and went
- Low means students were largely distracted

There are no right or wrong answers. Be honest.

## Weekly Reflection
Once a week, you answer one simple question:
"What worked this week?"

This helps you reflect beyond numbers and capture teaching moments that data alone cannot show.

## What the Dashboard Shows
The dashboard shows:
- Engagement trends over time
- Simple charts by class and subject
- Clear messages like "Doing fine", "Needs adjustment", or "Needs attention"

These are meant to guide reflection, not to score you.

## What This Tool Is Not
- It is not an inspection tool
- It is not used for grading teachers
- It is not shared with other teachers
- It is not used for punishment

This is your personal teaching journal, supported by simple analytics.

If anything feels unclear or stressful, stop and report it. The tool should make teaching lighter, not heavier.
