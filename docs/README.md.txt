# Classroom Reflection MVP

## Overview
Classroom Reflection MVP is a lightweight journal and analytics tool for secondary school teachers. It helps teachers reflect on classroom engagement and spot early patterns before academic performance drops.

The focus is on daily classroom experience, not exams alone.

## Who This Is For
- Secondary school teachers
- Schools running small pilot programs
- Education researchers exploring early engagement signals

Each teacher works independently. Schools and teachers cannot see each other’s data.

## What It Does
- Collects short daily classroom reflections
- Computes a simple Class Engagement Index (CEI)
- Shows engagement trends by class and subject
- Allows weekly reflective notes
- Stores clean, structured data for future analysis

## What It Does Not Do
- No student grading
- No teacher ranking
- No automated prediction yet
- No surveillance or monitoring language

## How To Run Locally
1. Install Python 3.9 or higher
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the app:
   streamlit run app.py

## Project Status
This is an MVP pilot intended for real classroom testing over one academic term.

Expect iteration, feedback, and improvements.

## Disclaimer
This tool is for reflection and research purposes only. It is not a replacement for professional judgment or school policy.
